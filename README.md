# 🛡️ FinGuard

## AI-Powered Financial Fraud Detection Platform

🚀 **Live Demo:**  
https://finguard-ai-fraud-detection.onrender.com

---

## 📖 Overview

FinGuard is a full-stack AI-powered web application designed to detect potentially fraudulent financial transactions in real time. It leverages Machine Learning to analyze transaction patterns, estimate fraud probability, and classify transactions into **Low**, **Medium**, or **High Risk** through an interactive dashboard.

The platform demonstrates the integration of Machine Learning, FastAPI, and modern web technologies to build an end-to-end fraud detection system suitable for banking and financial security applications.

> **Note:** The application is deployed on Render's free tier. The first request after inactivity may take approximately 30–60 seconds while the server wakes up.
