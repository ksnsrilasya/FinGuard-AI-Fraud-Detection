# 🛡️ FinGuard

## AI-Powered Financial Fraud Detection Platform

FinGuard is a full-stack web application that detects potentially fraudulent financial transactions using Machine Learning. The platform analyzes transaction details, predicts fraud risk, and provides a confidence score through an interactive dashboard. It demonstrates the integration of Machine Learning with modern backend development to solve a real-world financial security problem.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Financial institutions process thousands of transactions every minute, making manual fraud detection inefficient and time-consuming.

FinGuard automates this process by analyzing transaction patterns and classifying transactions into Low, Medium, or High Risk using a trained Machine Learning model. The application also provides transaction history, fraud analytics, and an intuitive dashboard for monitoring suspicious activity.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

The fraud detection model is trained using transaction data and predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent based on multiple transaction attributes.

### Input Features

- Transaction Amount
- Merchant Category
- Transaction Type
- Device Type
- Location
- Transaction Time
- Previous Fraud History
- Customer Age
- Payment Method

### Prediction Output

- Low Risk
- Medium Risk
- High Risk

The application also displays the fraud probability and confidence score for each prediction.

## 📊 Model Performance

| Metric | Value |
|---------|--------|
| ROC-AUC Score | **0.96** |
| Fraud Recall | **0.74** |
| Fraud Precision | **0.44** |

The trained model was evaluated using a Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve to assess classification performance.
